# Myself

Hi, I'm Marco Manganaro, also known as Fettenderi. I'm a 21 year old Sicilian Software Engineering student at the Polytechnic University of Turin. Ever since I was a child I always wanted to make cool games that people will love to play and share. To me videogames are more than just pure enterteinment, it is also a very powerful art medium.

I stepped foot on video game development 2020 when I participated in [my first ever game jam](https://fettenderi.itch.io/nobrake). Later next year I worked on [Time Tangled](https://fettenderi.itch.io/time-tangled) of which I'm more proud.

In 2022 I started studying the principles of Game Design and applying them into my new projects in collaboration with some amazing people. The first being a game made with the composer [Unconcious Motifs](https://unconscious-motifs.itch.io) for the MechJam IV, and the second with "Armata Branca Leone" for the game [Punch Line](https://fettenderi.itch.io/punch-line) during the GlobalGameJam2024. 

These experiences thought me that game development is about making experiences and living ones. I learned comunication and collaboration with other members of the game industry, I lived the fear of deadline and the joy of finishing a project with a team of people you have learned to work with.

# Music

Whether I'm commuting from university to home or studying, music is always a part of my daily routine. My favorite genres range from Italian hip-hop and nu jazz to video game soundtracks and Dutch alt-pop. To capture all my musical preferences, I've created a playlist that reflects my diverse tastes.
