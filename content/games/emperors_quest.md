This is a game project, done solely by me in two months, it was commissioned to me by Kendal, I'm not sharing it publicly to avoid a copyright violation from Mojang Studios. That said, I'll be glad to share with you the design details, the graphics and a full gameplay of said game.

The analysis of the game is divided in 4 core parts:
- [Level Design](/games/emperors_quest/level-design)
- [Gameplay Design](/games/emperors_quest/gameplay-design)
- [System Design](/games/emperors_quest/system-design)
- [Engine Designing Tools](/games/emperors_quest/engine-tools)
