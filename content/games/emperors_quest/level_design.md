title = "Emperor's Quest: Level Design"
+++

My design philosophy for each level is a constant. Create an amazing world in which the player can feel free to explore and discover the game mechanics introduced within.

The newly acquired item gets first introduced in little simple bits. Later down the level a change in the level structure signals also a twist in the level mechanics, with even harder challenges. All those challenges deserve a reward at the end of each level, be it a bunch of collectibles, a great view, a new item or a mix of those.

I'm going to do an highlight of the most memorable moments of the game, describing what I was trying to make the player feel and what I was trying to build up to.

# Alternate path in first cave
// 1. Freedom of choice
// 2. Encounter of the leaves wall -> Empowering of the flint and steel once acquired

# Exploding bridge
// 1. Curiosity and anger?
// 2. Desire to understand what that blue thing that triggered the tnts is -> Empowering the exploration of the Ancient City

# Deep dark exploration
// 1. Cautious and silent
// 2. The chasing sequence immediately after the Warden spawns -> Create contrast between the slow-quiet gameplay of the deep dark with the fast-frantic gameplay of the chase

# Introduction of vertical maagnetic surfaces
// 1. Freedom of movement in all the 2D plane ???
// 2. ??? even powerfuller 2D movement in the big crystal cave

# Removal of the golems
// 1. Powerless
// 2. Make the new acquisitions even more effective and feel powerful -> The enemies will become scared of you ???
