title = "Emperor's Quest: Level Design"
+++

I wanted each level to feel unique, to give to the player an adventourous journey through the world of minecraft while at the same time being the mighty emperor: Kendal.

At the start of each level I always put a small challenge using the skills the player has learned in the previous levels, that small challenge it is later flipped on its side in the middle of the level. I usually change the rules of the current level mechanic a bit to spice up gameplay and to never let the player get bored.

After an even thougher challenge at the end I give the player a reward, a new item/ability and a great view of the world they're exploring.

# Introduction:

The first level has a cutscene to let the player know the characters and the villain, and a basic controls tutorial. This also sets the character of the villain, an evil but childish individual with advanced tecnhology.

# Overworld 1:

The first real level is set in the overworld, here I introduce all the basic enemies: zombies, creepers and skeletons, and let the player explore the level in almost total freedom. Inside the cave I guide player's interest firstly towards the left to let them know there are resources to be collected and I hint them a fire mechanic to burn the leaves.

I later guide them upwards where the skeleton is shooting.

{{ resize_image(path="content/games/emperors_quest/no_brake.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}

The level ends with the new item and an hint about the next level. The player can now decide to proceed left or to backtrack to pick up the collectibles.

# Ancient City:

Going forward the player makes another encounter with the villain, this time in the form of these exploding TNTs on the bridge. The villain mocks him by placing paintings of themselves laughing. This scene also serves the purpuse of foreshadowing the mechanic of the level.

Inside the cave the player can choose different paths to explore, they all in the end bring you to the same zone: the leaf bridge. This can only be burned in two ways: the intended one is though a leaves socket connected to the bridge that can be burned, the other way is to bring a creeper near the bridge and let it explode, thus skipping all the bonus section.

Making a sound in this area triggers the sculk sensors that change the Ost into a more mysterious one. The deepest part of the cave is filled to the brim with Shrieker that if they are activated 4 times they will summon the Warden, an unbeatable powerful enemy.

At the end of the ancient city the player is forced to make a noise and to allert the Warden, this will start a chasing sequence till the end of the level. There the player can interact with a book that announces the theme of the next level.

# Supercharged Cave:

This section begins with a silent tutorial that teaches the player some properties of the magnetic mechanic.

{{ resize_image(path="content/games/emperors_quest/no_brake.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}

During the level I let the player explore all the quirks of magnetism, making use of vertical surfaces and superpowered ones.

{{ resize_image(path="content/games/emperors_quest/no_brake.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}

On the ending section, the level reveals the nature of the crystals through the shape of the cave and the description of the item, revealing the origin of the lively magnetic power and its creatures.

{{ resize_image(path="content/games/emperors_quest/no_brake.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}

# Overworld 2:

The player, right out of the cave, is rewarded with a new ability that can be tested with the chickens. This is just to give the player a taste of what the controller can do, and later in the next level this will become clear.

# Villain's Mansion:

Designing the mansion was a bit harder at first, becasue all the previous levels where set in a more natural environment. I wanted the place to feel really detailed and steampunk-like. Although the level layout it is still too blocky, I think that I was able to achieve the aesthetic I wanted using the chandeliers.
