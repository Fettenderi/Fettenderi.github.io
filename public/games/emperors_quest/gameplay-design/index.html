Its main feature was the usage of the sword, flint & steel and a fishing rod.<p>Following that idea I started sketching some of the uses for these items:<h1 id=flint-steel>Flint & steel:</h1><p>Used to start fires, ignite TNTs, damage close up enemies and deactivate magnets. This elegantly encompasses a lot of features into a single item, making it a useful addition to your inventory. It also adds a risk reward-machanic, there is a damage boost if the enemy is hit using the flint & steel from up close.<h1 id=fishing-rod>Fishing rod:</h1><p>I wanted this item to be used as a grappling hook, used even to bring enemies closer, to let them hang high and then let them take fall damage.<p>But in the end I scrapped this idea to make space for a more elegant and original idea. This free movement mechanic took form into the Amulet and all the Supercharged Redstone mechanic.<h1 id=bag-of-seeds>Bag of seeds:</h1><p>This was the first iteration of the Magneto-Resonant Controller. Initially this item would only attract and control hordes of chickens, ending the final sequence with a giant chicken made out of chickens wrecking the villain's mansion door.<p>It was replaced with the Controller to make it more in line with the other items, also I didn't like the idea of a simple bag of seeds being this powerful. The giant chicken idea got scrapped too because during early prototypes it didn't look as I wanted it to be. The ins and outs of this mechanic will be discussed in the System Design part.<hr><p>Another very important, but also very silent gameplay mechanic are all the redstone contraptions. They make possible all of the complex features such as: moving platforms, dispensers, TNTs and also the final bossfight.<p>Redstone is implemented in Engine using 2 kind of object:<h1 id=sender>Sender</h1><p>which is capable of sending an activation signal to all its connected receivers.<h1 id=receiver>Receiver</h1><p>which receives signals to perform particular actions.<h1 id=sender-receiver-inheritance>[Sender-Receiver Inheritance]</h1><img src=https://fettenderimakes.games/processed_images/no_brake.f2a89b2d605a846e.png><p>A receiver is also a sender with some other functionality attached to it. This makes it possible to chain actions together even with custom timings.</section></article></main></div>
