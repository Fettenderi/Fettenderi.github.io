I had the opportunity to collaborate with an amazing composer experienced with Wwise and FMOD.<p>At the start of the project, I was overly ambitious and ended up designing numerous enemies and features. This was the plan I originally had in mind:<p><img src=https://fettenderimakes.games/processed_images/image4.670be2b67243b4e9.png> <img src=https://fettenderimakes.games/processed_images/image5.7d78af3128fdf2b1.png><p>By the time we submitted the game, we had zero hours of sleep, only three enemies, three weapons, poor aesthetics, and no polish.<p>Through this experience, I learned a tough lesson: beware of scope creep, as it can turn a good idea into a complete mess.<p>Despite the challenges, I really enjoyed working with my teammate <a href=https://unconscious-motifs.itch.io>Unconcious Motifs</a>. He created an incredible dynamic OST for the game, which, along with the buildings I designed as props, were probably the best parts of the project.<p><img src=https://fettenderimakes.games/processed_images/image2.b72d0e9626c1fa4a.png> <img src=https://fettenderimakes.games/processed_images/image3.d5747c3dbe4b5467.png> <img src=https://fettenderimakes.games/processed_images/image1.cfcca80927e083d0.png> <img src=https://fettenderimakes.games/processed_images/image.f601446231f8ba1e.png><p>The game is rough around the edges but it's still playable, give it a try.</p><a href=https://fettenderi.itch.io/projectmecha-alien>Try it!</a></section></article></main></div>
