I'd always kept my distance from Unity, despite watching many tutorials and trying the engine a few times, it just never clicked for me. However, after observing an experienced user work with it for a few hours, I was able to contribute to various parts of the project.<p>My primary responsibility was implementing the SFX and OST using FMOD. Having worked with FMOD before, I was already familiar with its quirks and challenges.<p>During the whole two days of development I also helped the Game Designer suggesting new mechanics to work on.<p>If you want to try it, the game is really fun to play. I would recommend playing it with a friend to make the experience more ilarious.</p><a href=https://fettenderi.itch.io/punch-line>Try it!</a></section></article></main></div>
